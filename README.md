**Instructions to run code - Desktop app:**

Utilizing a code editor (like Visual Studio Code), open up the repository to get to the "Prysm\Software\prysm" directory on a terminal (such as node or powershell). If "Node" or "npm" is not downloaded, it may be necessary that you download that software before running this project. Once "Node" and "npm" is successfully downloaded,  within the terminal, run the code: 

```
npm install
npm run electron:serve   
```
